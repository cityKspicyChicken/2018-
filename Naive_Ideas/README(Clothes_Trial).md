# Augmented Reality based Clothes Trial

This could be a naive idea about how to implement the AR based Clothes Trial Demo

## Steps
1. Build the naked model body(in Blender or similar Softwares);
(for the real body of comsumer we can maybe use some cameras and sensors to get the raw model,then we can tune it up by using some methods)
2. Create some kinds of clothes 2D models in different sizes and colors(for size: S M L XL etc.;for clors: many);
3. Using clothes Simulation methods in Blender(see video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szEeu6_b4fg);
(because Blender is open-source software maybe we can only use the source code of the simulation part to implement our own Demo)
4. Repair the clothes models to body suitable models;
(I think this step we can adopt some Machine Learning methods, sothat this step will automatic excution)
5. Build a front-end GUI for the Clothes Trial in realtime.

### Prerequisites

Software: Blender, Tensorflow, Teras or some others?

Hardware: Kinect, or some other Sensors or some others?

Others: some research from garment industry for the clothes or somethings important for real-time clothes trial?

## Evaluation

After we build our Demo, we should first try it and find the evaluation methods to tune it up.

### Other questions

1.what is the technically difficult point for the implementation of this Demo?

2.where is the innovative point?

3.how much is the potential value for the market?

and so on...
